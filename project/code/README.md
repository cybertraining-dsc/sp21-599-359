# Deep Learning in Drug Discovery Code Instructions (For Google Colab)


To run code from this project, open the predicting_molecular_activity.ipynb notebook in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)

## Run installation of prerequisite packages 

## Sign Up for Kaggle Account and Generate API Token
   1. Sign Up for Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com.
   2. In Kaggle 'Profile'->'Account', generate api token by clicking 'Create New API Token'.

## Upload Token into Colab
   1. Upload json file, with Kaggle api token and username, into Colab by running code in predicting_molecular_activity.ipynb notebook.
